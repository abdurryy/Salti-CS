This project aims to develop a WiFi calling application that allows users to make phone calls over a WiFi network instead of traditional cellular networks. WiFi calling, also known as VoWiFi (Voice over WiFi), provides an alternative method for making phone calls in areas with weak or no cellular signal but a reliable WiFi connection.
